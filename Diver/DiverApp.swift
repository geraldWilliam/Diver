/// The entry point of the application. Keep this file brief. The App should perform the following tasks:
///
/// - Instantiate global services.
/// - Inject global observables.
/// - Create an AppDelegate if needed.
///
/// Any user interface setup should happen in `ContentView`.
///
/// A note on Environment: Use the environment to inject dependencies that are needed more than one step into the parent-child view hierarchy. The Timeline
/// presented in ContentViewâ€˜s body needs a `PostsController`. Rather than passing the controller to ContentView and then forwarding it to the Timeline, we
/// put it in the environment.
