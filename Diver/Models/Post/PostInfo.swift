/// A domain model to represent a Post. TootSDKâ€˜s Post type is actually suitable for direct usage in this application but `PostInfo` provides a representation of
/// that external model that only declares the properties we actually use and performs some transformations upon initialization (like converting strings to URLs) to
/// save us a little work later.
///
/// `Identifiable`
/// Models should conform to Identifiable if they need to be displayed in SwiftUI Lists, ForEach, etc.
///
/// `Hashable`
/// Models should conform to Hashable if they need to be selectable in SwiftUI Lists, enumerable by ForEach, etc.
///
/// In many cases, your domain model will be parsed not from an external model type but from raw JSON data. In such cases, declare `Codable` conformance in
/// addition to `Identifiable` and `Hashable`.
